Alright, so this POST accepts some data, in which we aren’t allowed to add ' ', and pickle is the one who takes care of this.\nLet’s talk about pickle a little bit. It’s an object serialization for python, that can serialize functions, classes, all that. Please read this document.\nSince this challenge uses python 2.7, we also need to use python 2.7. And I used an online compiler because I am not wrestling with installing crap I’m only using once on kali.\nThis didn’t work. I tried a sleep command too, but didn’t work either. I got stuck for a while, and I found the gotcha in another writeup. Flask does this thing, where if it recognizes the Content-Type of our body, it consumes it and puts it somewhere else like request.form, request.json, whatever.\nThis means our body aka request.data becomes a big b\"\". So we need to send a Content-Type it has no idea about, like for example, application/testing.\nThis time, my (time.sleep, (5,)) command worked! By this I mean, it took them 5 to respond. I tried using os.system, but that didn’t work, because since it was spawning a separate process, I couldn’t see the I/O. And creating files didn’t work. So we have to use eval, because it’s executed in the same process as the pickle.\nAnd to actually see what’s getting displayed, we need to raise an exception, like we did by sending a bad POST.\nThe final working payload was\nimport cPickle import base64 import os class X(object): def __reduce__(self): return (eval, (\"eval(open('flag').read())\",)) payload = cPickle.dumps(X(), protocol=2) print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(payload)) Because it would first eval and fetch the flag contents, and then display an error about evaling it.\nI guess that’s it!\n",

<p>This is <em>EXACTLY</em> like <a href="irinasusca.github.io/writeup-blog/slightly-broken">slightly-broken</a> (you could take a look at it, it&rsquo;s short), except the <code>pin</code> things are actually being used!</p>

<p>Because of this message, <em>You can find the PIN printed out on the standard output of your shell that runs the server.</em>, I thought about doing an <code>nmap</code> to see if there&rsquo;s any interesting ports open.</p>
<p>There were, but it was a bunch of other challenges.</p>
<p>I stopped using LLMs and googled for known exploits, and <strong><a href="https://angelica.gitbook.io/hacktricks/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/werkzeug">getting the pin ourselves</a></strong> <em>IS</em> possible, but we need some sort of path traversal vulnerability.</p>
<p>In the last challenge, we had access to the error page directly, but this time we need a way to reach it by ourselves. sending a <code>POST</code> request with curl gives us this!</p>
