Extract the flag from the pcap.

This challenge is just a bunch of GET requests, from /page0 to /page9 of something about Chunk Norris.
I sifted through a bunch of the HTTP requests and the only thing that seemed to change irregularly was the http.user_agent: It looked like User-Agent: curl/0 00 0 0 0, with the 0s and spaces alternating seemingly randomly. I thought that might be a binary code throughout the million requests, with the spaces having to be FILLED with 1s (you know, since the name is exFILL) but it turned out to be a bunch of gibberish.">
