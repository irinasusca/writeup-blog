## Why

Since this is, sadly, something that needs to be done in order to score points in ctfs, I'm going to cover some things that *I* feel  are important in this category. 

I have done quite a few forensics challenges, but I never really mastered `grep` and `tshark` to their full potential. And I forgot most of my Wireshark expertise from last year, so I'll include what I feel is important or non-intuitive about that as well.

I'm writing this as I learn, so keep that in mind.

## Grep

Feel free to skip this if you already know your stuff with grep. I for one always avoided learning this in depth, so that's what I'll be doing now.

We all know the basic syntax, `grep "string" /path/file`. There is also the color-text-in-file `--color` parameter.
